- [ ] Unit tests are written and passing (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests cover API endpoints
- [ ] API documentation is updated
- [ ] Frontend components are responsive
- [ ] Security scanning passes without high/critical issues
- [ ] Features work in development environment

### Sprint 1 Deliverables
1. **Authentication System**: Complete user registration and login with JWT
2. **Account Management**: Create, read, update, delete user accounts
3. **Transaction Operations**: Basic CRUD operations for transactions
4. **CSV Import Feature**: Bulk transaction import with validation
5. **React Foundation**: Core components and routing structure

## 🚧 Known Risks & Dependencies

### Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| JWT implementation complexity | Medium | Low | Use established libraries (python-jose, bcrypt) |
| CSV parsing edge cases | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive test cases, robust error handling |
| React state management complexity | Medium | Low | Keep state simple, use Context API judiciously |
| Database schema changes | Low | Medium | Proper migrations, version control |

### External Dependencies
| Dependency | Status | Expected Date | Backup Plan |
|------------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| None (self-contained) | - | - | - |

## 📈 Sprint Planning Decisions

### Team Commitments
- **Developer**: Full-time commitment (40 hours/week)
- **Focus**: Backend-first approach, then frontend integration
- **Quality**: Emphasis on testing and documentation from day one

### Technical Decisions
- **Architecture**: Maintain clean separation between API and frontend
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL migration path planned
- **Testing**: Pytest for backend, Jest/React Testing Library for frontend
- **Standards**: Follow established coding standards and commit conventions

## 🔄 Daily Progress Tracking

**Review Schedule**: Daily progress check at 5:00 PM  
**Format**: 
- What was completed today?
- What will be worked on tomorrow?
- Are there any blockers or concerns?
- Any learnings or decisions made?
