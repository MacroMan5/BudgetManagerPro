   - Verify frontend functionality in browser

4. **Code Review & Quality**
   - Self-review code for quality and standards
   - Run linting and formatting tools
   - Check test coverage meets requirements (>90%)
   - Update documentation if needed

5. **Commit & Push**
   - Commit changes with conventional commit format
   - Push feature branch to remote repository
   - Monitor CI/CD pipeline results

### Evening Routine (End of Day)
1. **Progress Review**
   - Update task status and notes
   - Document any learnings or decisions made
   - Identify tomorrow's priorities

2. **Code Cleanup**
   - Ensure all changes are committed
   - Clean up any temporary files or logs
   - Prepare for next day's work

## 🛠️ Technical Workflow

### Backend Development (FastAPI)
1. **Model Development**
   ```bash
   # Create new model
   # Write tests first
   pytest tests/test_models.py::test_new_model -v
   # Implement model
   # Create migration
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add new model"
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. **API Endpoint Development**
   ```bash
   # Write API tests
   pytest tests/test_api.py::test_new_endpoint -v
   # Implement endpoint
   # Test with manual API calls
   # Update OpenAPI documentation
   ```

3. **Testing Strategy**
   ```bash
   # Run specific test file
   pytest tests/test_auth.py -v
   # Run with coverage
   pytest --cov=src tests/
   # Run integration tests
   pytest tests/integration/ -v
   ```

### Frontend Development (React)
1. **Component Development**
   ```bash
   # Start development server
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   # Create component with tests
   # Implement component logic
   # Test in browser and with unit tests
   npm test ComponentName
   ```

2. **API Integration**
   ```bash
   # Test API calls
   # Implement error handling
   # Update TypeScript interfaces
   # Test with different data scenarios
   ```

### Database Management
1. **Schema Changes**
   ```bash
   # Create migration
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description"
   # Review generated migration
   # Test migration up and down
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. **Data Management**
   ```bash
   # Seed development data
   python scripts/seed_data.py
   # Backup database
   cp data/budget_manager.db data/backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).db
   ```
